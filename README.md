Using Java, I coded a “Sandwhich Shop”, that takes a customer first and last name, and allows them to select the bread type, vegetables, and meat they would like on their sandwhich. 
Their total is then added up to show the total amount of the order. Once the order is completed, the customer is asked if they would like to order another sandwhich. If the customer 
does not want to order another sandwhich, the loop ends.
